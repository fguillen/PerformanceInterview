From some interviews with Pedro Costa, I found his method similar to sociologist Jean-Yves Petiteau’s approach of deep listening to the interviewee person. I find intriguing the **necessity of subtleness defined by devotion to listening in encounter with the other**, that is a trigger for opening the relation with the space of the other, the environment of personal identity. **\"To be listening is to be on the border of meaning.\"** said Petiteau once in a.pass, and he also referred to listening as an action admitting that one doesn’t know.\n\nIn the context of the performance it is usually the audience in the position of the listener. But I remember that you experimented with the position of listener in one of your projects (or in more?) – **how did you experience the listening from the place where you are expected to \"talk\"?**" }
